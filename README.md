This is a project using a fictional client data from a fictional bike rental company combining order, customer, location, and bike information. 
The data is provided by a public practice database, and is imported into its own database using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. 
Using SQL, the data is cleaned by creating a query that returns only the necessary information that the fictional stakeholders requested for. 
The query is imported into Microsoft Excel and the database is connected. This allows for the upcoming dashboards to be updated on its own, without needing manual input. 
Using Excel, pivot tables are created which allows me to create a dashboard and filters within Excel to convert the data into presentable form.
I also attempted the data visualization in Tablaeu, which resulted in a similar dashboard creation experience and allows for the presentation dashboard to be viewed online.
There are still a few bugs in the Tableau dashboard that need to be worked out.
